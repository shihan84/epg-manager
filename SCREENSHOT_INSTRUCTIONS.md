# 📸 EPG Manager - Screenshot Instructions

## 🎯 **Your EPG Manager is Ready for Screenshots!**

I've set up everything you need to capture professional screenshots of your EPG Manager interface and upload them to GitHub.

## 🚀 **Two Ways to Capture Screenshots**

### **Option 1: Quick Manual Method (Recommended)**
This is the fastest way to get screenshots right now.

#### **Step 1: Open Your Browser**
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

#### **Step 2: Capture These Pages**
Use your browser's screenshot tool (F12 → Elements → Camera icon) or system screenshot tool:

1. **Homepage** → Save as `01-homepage.png`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Capture: Full landing page

2. **Sign In** → Save as `02-signin.png`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin`
   - Capture: Login form with demo credentials

3. **Sign Up** → Save as `03-signup.png`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/auth/signup`
   - Capture: Registration form

4. **Dashboard** → Save as `04-dashboard.png`
   - Login: `demo@example.com` / `password`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
   - Capture: Stats and quick actions

5. **Channels** → Save as `05-channels.png`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/channels`
   - Capture: Channels list

6. **Programs** → Save as `06-programs.png`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/programs`
   - Capture: Programs with copy buttons

7. **Schedules** → Save as `07-schedules.png`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/schedules`
   - Capture: Schedule management

8. **EPG Export** → Save as `08-epg-export.png`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/epg`
   - Capture: EPG export interface

9. **Admin Panel** → Save as `09-admin-panel.png`
   - Login: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
   - Capture: Admin dashboard

#### **Step 3: Create Folder and Upload**
```bash
# Create screenshots folder
mkdir -p screenshots

# Move your screenshots there
# (Move the files you captured to the screenshots folder)

# Upload to GitHub
git add screenshots/
git commit -m "feat: Add interface screenshots"
git push origin master
```

### **Option 2: Automated Method**
Use the automated script I created:

```bash
# Run the automated screenshot capture
npm run screenshots
```

This will automatically:
- Login with demo credentials
- Navigate to each page
- Capture full-page screenshots
- Save them with correct filenames
- Create a README file

## 📁 **What You'll Get**

After capturing screenshots, you'll have:
